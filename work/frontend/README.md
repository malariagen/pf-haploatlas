# Guide to running app

Python 3.9.10

cd to this directory

pip install streamlit==1.25.0 and streamlit_plotly_events==0.0.6

run `python3 -m streamlit run app_latest.py` in command line

if the app doesn't open by itself, copy the `Network URL` and paste it into your browser (should be something like http://10.160.20.64:8501)
